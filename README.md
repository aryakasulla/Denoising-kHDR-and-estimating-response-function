# Denoising-kHDR-and-estimating-response-function

This repository contains code used to denoise and estimate clean fits for raw ketamine evoked haemodynamic response function (kHDR).\
You will need to clone the modified version of scipy from my repository.\
Final.ipynb contains code to estimate fits, FLIRT.m performs co-registration of the estimated fits in the same space and Avg_std.ipynb performs basic statistics on the registrated dataset.
